A video-version of this report is availabale via the link in this repository. 

## 📊 Project Overview

This analysis investigates the high product return rate at Superstore—**25.97% overall**—and aims to answer the following:

* Where are return rates the highest?
* What is driving the high return rate?
* What actionable steps can we take to reduce it?

Using Tableau, calculated fields, and visual dashboards, this project identifies the key segments, regions, timeframes, and shipping behaviors contributing to returns.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. High-Return Customers

A bar chart sorted by return rate shows that **consumer-segment customers using same-day shipping** are disproportionately responsible for returns.

### 2. Regional Breakdown

* The **Western region**, especially California, exhibits the **highest return rates**.
* Profit and return rate are correlated—return-heavy regions often show decreased profitability.

### 3. Product Patterns

* **Paper and Binders** stand out with both high sales and high return counts.
* Category-level trends were minor, but subcategory analysis provided valuable clarity.

### 4. Seasonal Trends

* **August, September, and December** all exceed **30% return rate**.
* Returns peak during **Back-to-School** and **Holiday** seasons.

### 5. Shipping Mode Impact

* **Same-Day shipping**, particularly on **Thursdays and Fridays**, shows **the highest return likelihood**.
* Many returns stem from items not delivered on time- a factor outside Superstore’s control.

## 💡 Recommendations

* **Return Policy Update:**
  Implement a stricter return policy for **same-day deliveries** made on **Thursdays, Fridays, or holidays**.
  Include a **pop-up warning** on the website clarifying that same-day orders on these days are **not guaranteed** and **not eligible for return due to delayed delivery.**

* **Holiday Restrictions:**
  Disable same-day delivery options on major **holidays** (e.g., Christmas) to prevent undeliverable orders and frustrated customers.

## 📈 Tools Used

* Tableau (for dashboards and visual analysis)
* Calculated fields (to determine return rates)
* Segment, Region, Category, and Time-based filters for insight slicing

## 🧠 Conclusion

By analyzing return rates by **region, customer segment, ship mode, and time**, this project uncovers actionable insights. Implementing targeted policy changes can significantly **reduce unnecessary returns**, **improve customer experience**, and **boost profitability**.
