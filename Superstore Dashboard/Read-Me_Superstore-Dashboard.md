## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This project was completed as part of the TripleTen BIA program. It analyzes key financial challenges at Superstore using Tableau dashboards and offers actionable recommendations.

The report covers three core areas:

1. **Profits and Losses**
2. **Advertising Strategy**
3. **Returned Items & Policy Recommendations**

> _Note: This version has been adapted for GitHub from coursework. Further refinements to improve presentation are ongoing._

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- **Biggest Losses** stem from the GBC DocuBind P400 shipped via Standard Class.
- **Top Profits** come from Canon Copiers also shipped via Standard Class.
- **Tables** are consistent loss-makers across all regions.
- **Advertising** is most effective in:
  - Washington (March)
  - California (August)
  - New York (September)
- **Returns** don't always correlate with lossesâ€”some high-return-rate customers still generate profit.
- **Major Outlier:** A single return caused a $22K loss (10% of all-time loss).

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Tableau (Dashboards & Visualizations)
- Custom Calculated Fields
- Outlier Detection
- Dimensional Analysis by Region, Category, and Customer

## âœ… Recommendations

- Stop selling consistently unprofitable items.
- Invest in advertising only in proven state/month combinations.
- Apply stricter return policies for:
  - High-cost items
  - Same-day delivery orders
  - Returns over $100
