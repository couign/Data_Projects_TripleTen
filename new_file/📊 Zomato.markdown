## 📌 Introduction

Using customer order data collected between **October 4, 2017** and **June 26, 2020**, this analysis:

- Profiles Zomato’s customer demographics
- Builds two key cohort segments:
  - **Student vs. Non-Student**

- Analyzes purchase behavior across these segments
- Recommends a strategic promotion to improve user retention

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

### Part 1: Creating Cohorts

- **Student Segment**: Over **53%** of users are students.
- **Order Size Insight**: Median order is for one item, suggesting Zomato is used primarily for solo meals.
- **Ordering Patterns**: Orders are concentrated on weekdays—implying Zomato is used during work/school hours for convenience.

### Part 2: Order Frequency

- Most users order **once or twice** in their lifetime.
- A significant increase in order frequency occurs **after the 3rd order**.
- Average time between orders:
  - **2 orders** → ~10.7 months between orders
  - **More than 3 orders** → Time between orders decreases noticeably
